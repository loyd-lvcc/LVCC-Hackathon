# La Verdad Christian College 1st Hackathon
### Challenges of ICT Students
###### Develop a program that will help ICT students in their daily challenges.

**Hacking starts upon registration until the day of the event. Teams can still work in their project until the day of hackathon. Demo of the projects will start at 3pm.**

#### hack·a·thon
*ˈhakəˌTHän/*

*noun informal*

an event, typically lasting several days, in which a large number of people meet to engage in collaborative computer programming.


#### The spirit of the competition
Remember that hackathons are like marathons. Some people go to compete but most people take part to better themselves and have fun. Whatever the reason is you're at a hackathon, make sure you're upholding the hacker spirit by collaborating with other teams, helping beginners, and having fun.




### Hackathon Rule Book

#### Team Size
There is no maximum or minimum team size. Teams should be made up exclusively of students who are not organizers, volunteers, judges, or in any other privileged position at the event.

#### Intellectual Property Rights
All submissions remain the intellectual property of the individuals or organizations that developed them.

#### Protection of Intellectual Property
By submitting an Entry or accepting any prize, you represent and warrant the following: you will not submit content that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the content; and the content submitted by you does not contain any viruses, Trojan horses, worms or other disabling devices or harmful code.

#### Copyright
Participant represents and warrants that he or she is the sole author and copyright owner of the Submission, and that the Submission is an original work of the Participant, or if the Submission is a work based on an existing application, that the Participant has acquired sufficient rights to use and to authorize others; and that the Submission does not infringe upon any copyright or upon any other third party rights of which the Participant is aware, and that the Submission is free of malware.

#### Eligibility
La Verdad Christian College organizers have the right at their sole discretion to determine whether an entrant is eligible for the Contest. La Verdad Christian College may disqualify, at organizers’ sole discretion, La Verdad Christian College entries (including, without limitation, content submitted in connection therewith) that (a) are in violation of third party rights or law or regulation, (b) use inappropriate or explicit language or images, or display content that La Verdad Christian College finds objectionable.

#### Winner Selection/Judging Criteria
Teams will be judged on these four criteria. Judges will weigh the criteria equally. During judging, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project:

* **Technology**: How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components? Did the technology involved make you go "Wow"?
* **Design**: Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface? For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or graphics are. For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is (e.g. is it easy to use or does it use a cool interface?).
* **Completion**: Does the hack work? Did the team achieve everything they wanted?
* **Learning**: Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new? What kind of projects have they worked on before? If a team which always does virtual reality projects decides to switch up and try doing a mobile app instead, that exploration should be rewarded


These criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which projects are the most impressive and most deserving.


#### Awards
Contest prizes are non-transferable by the winner.

**1st Place** – ₱2,000

**2nd Place** – ₱1,000

**3rd Place** – ₱500
